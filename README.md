# ALGM React Club

The first rule of React Club is ... well, you know the drill.

The more important rule of React club is that you _have_ to bring the code weekly, and explain it to the group.

What's super important here is that you understand everything that you've done in a week, including the background theory (as far as possible). Try not to copy/paste code that you don't understand but that seems to do what you want - remember, none of this is rocket science, everything is understandable if you have the right mental model.


## Phase 1 - 4 Weeks long.

We're going to be building a simple TODO application through several iterations.

### Week 1 - Simple TODO MVC

1. Take a look at [TODO MVC](http://todomvc.com/) to get a sense of what we want to build this week. Essentially we want to have a page that allows us to add, check off, and remove TODO items.
2. Work through the official [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) if you haven't already - this will teach you pretty much all the techniques you need for this first week - you can stop just before the section on "Adding Time Travel".
3. While the React tutorial uses Codepen as a base, we should be writing locally - a good project to use to bootstrap your own project is [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
4. If you hit any issues, pop a question in Training and tag Blaize or Mustapha, we'll come a'running.


### Week 2 - Add a backend

### Week 3 - Add Routing

### Week 4 - Add authentication
