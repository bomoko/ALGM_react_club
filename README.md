# ALGM React Club

The first rule of React Club is ... well, you know the drill.

The more important rule of React club is that you _have_ to bring the code weekly, and explain it to the group.

What's super important here is that you understand everything that you've done in a week, including the background theory (as far as possible). Try not to copy/paste code that you don't understand but that seems to do what you want - remember, none of this is rocket science, everything is understandable if you have the right mental model.


## Phase 1 - 4 Weeks long.

### Week 1 - Simple TODO MVC

### Week 2 - Add a backend

### Week 3 - Add Routing

### Week 4 - Add authentication
